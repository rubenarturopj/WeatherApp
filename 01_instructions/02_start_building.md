# Buildin the UI

1. Start building your website. Create a container in the same file. Add the pictures.

-   Pictures are placed in the `asset` folder.

2. Add conditinal rendering to the pictures using inline properties, according to the temperature wanted. At the moment we'are creating a static condition, later we'll make it dynamic by using an external API that will provide us the temperature.

```sh
ngIf
```

ng is like saying "render", render if

3. Go to to the global css in `styles.css`. And style.

4. Keep going until we finish with the UI.
